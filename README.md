## üì¶ Fubon SDK Setup

This project requires the **Fubon SDK (`fubon_neo.sdk`)**, which is **not available on PyPI**.

To run this script:

1. You must have an active trading account with Fubon Securities.  
2. Request access to their Python SDK via your broker or Fubon customer support.  
3. After receiving the SDK package (usually a `.zip` or folder), place it in your working environment and ensure it is importable (e.g., placed alongside `exit_monitor.py` or added to `PYTHONPATH`).

> ‚ùó This repository **does not include or distribute** the SDK itself due to licensing restrictions.
